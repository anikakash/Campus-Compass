# Project Report
# Name of the project: PhD Hunter 
## Course Name: Web Engineering Lab CSE-415
# 1. Introduction: 

A comprehensive information portal website about institutions is what the PhD Hunter initiative seeks to create. Users will be able to do university searches on the website using a variety of criteria, including name, department, length of courses, and location. Access to enter, amend, and remove university data will only be available to registered admins. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, PHP, and MySQL will all be used in the project's implementation.

# 2. Motivation: 

The PhD Hunter project's goal is to establish a centralized platform where users can quickly obtain data on colleges and universities for higher education. Finding comprehensive information on colleges, programs, and departments can be difficult for students and researchers. By offering a user-friendly website that enables users to search for institutions depending on their unique criteria, this initiative seeks to streamline the procedure.

# 3. Objective : 

The development of an information portal that acts as a complete source for university information is the main goal of the PhD Hunter project. The precise goals consist of:

- Creating a user-friendly interface with basic navigational and search tools.
- Putting in place safe user authentication and authorisation procedures.
- Giving administrators access to an admin panel so they may add, edit, and delete university data.
- Enabling users to look up institutions using criteria like name, department, length of courses, and location.
-Providing comprehensive data on a few universities.

# 4. Features:

Certainly! The aspects of the PhD Hunter project are described in greater detail below:

The following are the main aspects of the PhD Hunter project:
- User registration and login: Visitors to the website can sign up and log in using their information.
- Admin ability and Management: Only logged-in admins have the ability to add, edit, and remove university data.
- University Search: Users may look up universities using criteria like name, department, length of courses, and location.Comprehensive University Information: Users may access in-depth information about particular universities.
- User Logout: Administrators may safely exit their accounts.
- Encryption: To protect user registration, we encrypt data using the Message Digest Algorithm 5.

# 7. Future Work :
To enhance the functionality and expand the PhD Hunter project, the following future work can be considered:
- Advanced search options: Include additional search parameters such as ranking, tuition fees, admission requirements, and available scholarships.
- User profiles: Implement user profiles where users can save their favorite universities, track their search history, and receive personalized recommendations.
- User reviews and ratings: Allow users to provide feedback, reviews, and ratings for universities, contributing to a dynamic and informative platform.
- Social media integration: Integrate social media sharing options to enable users to share universities or specific information with their networks.
- Notifications and alerts: Implement a notification system to update users about new university additions or updates.
- Mobile app development: Create a mobile application version of the PhD Hunter project to reach a wider audience and provide a convenient mobile experience.

# 8. Conclusion :
The PhD Hunter project aims to develop an information portal website that simplifies the process of accessing and
